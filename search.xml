<p>E.g<br>Plant diversity effect on soil microbial function and enzymes are stronger than warming in a grassland experiement</p>
<p>3 Hyposises</p>
<p>More into the paper:<br>Plants diversity &amp; plts are divided into three subplots<br>Different heat treatments</p>

    <title>What would happen with you and your peers after 10 years?</title>
    <url>/2022/07/29/What-would-happen-with-you-and-your-peers-after-10-years/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>From this video<br><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kB4y1Q7nn?spm_id_from=333.1007.tianma.1-3-3.click&amp;vd_source=60064b28be52500ccc945fd8bd7e934b">https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kB4y1Q7nn?spm_id_from=333.1007.tianma.1-3-3.click&amp;vd_source=60064b28be52500ccc945fd8bd7e934b</a></p>
<p>Yea what would happen after 10 year with you?<br>In 10 years time, we would get married, have a children, earn more money, and etc. But that is just one way of living, your peers who are in acedmics might become a professor in some famous univeristies. Everything can happen in 10 year time.<br>You might be wonder, what are the key factors that made the differences? Welp we can’t find any.<br>Is it hardwork? Maybe, but there are a lot of people who did hardwork, but they you would see their grades was actaully going down for some reason. They have a lot of pressure and they seems to be stucked in a dead cycle. </p>
<p>But again, you cannot success without any hardwork. As a result, hardworking is the at least thing that we can do. </p>
<p>Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional</p>
<p>There are many possible roads of your life, but it does not mean u will be stuck in one road. You can switch to any other roads you want, but there are cost when you switch between the roads. </p>
<p>逆水行舟，不进则退。<br>You cannot stay there, you must keep going up and up.<br>As a programmer, you need to keep going up and up. Learn more and more. </p>
<p>A breif summary:<br>1，同一学校毕业的，也能发展差别很大，世界是荒谬混沌的。但持续的努力是个人唯一能把握的事，否则只能被命运掌控住。<br>2，不同的道路都可追求自己努力的上限，不管个人运气好坏，不要相信能平着躺平，世界充满着争夺挤压抢占，充满着洗牌，不进则退。<br>3，生活架构要尽可能搭建在自己身上，而不是依靠外界和他人，持续创造价值，持续成长，才能抵抗未知的风险。<br>4，收入是跳跃式增长的，提供的价值上台阶了，收入才会跳跃式增长。收入和提供的价值是个价格和价值的关系，可能会有德不配位和通货膨胀，最终会有价值回归，专注价值提升。<br>5，请提高抗挫折能力，请习惯日常的挫折，这就是人生常态，这个世界没有答案。</p>
